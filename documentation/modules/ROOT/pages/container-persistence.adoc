= Containers and Persistence

Containers are meant to be run as "immutable" instances that exactly match the state of the image that they were started from (as we saw in the last section).  However, there many scenarios where adjusting this otherwise immutable state would be useful such as:

* Having the containers running the same image run differently in different environments (e.g. Preproduction vs Production environments)
** For instance, having applications in the container consume different configuration data based on the environment
* Persisting state beyond the life of the container (e.g. Databases, logfiles)
* Sharing state between containers  

Luckily, containers have facilities to support all these things.  We'll explore some of these features in this section

[#start_database]
== Start Database Container

. Start your database by running the following command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    --rm #<.>
    --name mysql_database #<.>
    -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db <.>
    -p 3306:3306 
    quay.io/mhildenb/mysql-80
----
<.> This means the container should be removed once stopped
<.> Instead of referring to the container by its `Container ID` we can provide a name by which we'd like to address the container
<.> These are environment variables that we would like to be made available within the container.  In this instance, these are all environment variables that MySQL uses to set itself up
+
. The terminal should be taken over with log output from the container.  This is because we did not run the container in "daemon mode" and instead it is running in the foreground of our terminal.
. Open a second terminal to the side by hitting the terminal split button 
+

+
. Observe the running container image by running the `podman ps` command
+

----
<.> Notice that this is the name we assigned the container above

[#create_database]
== Create Database
. Let's create our database providing the output of a .sql file to a mysql cli that is running in the container.  To do this we will use the `podman exec` command
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat /home/{user}/container-workshop/sql/example_database.sql | \#<.>
    podman exec \#<.>
    -i \#<.>
    mysql_database \#<.>
    mysql -u user -p'pass' -D db #<.>
----
<.> output the contents of the .sql file that creates the example database to STDIN
<.> Run a command in a (running) container
<.> interactive: makes STDIN available to whatever command we are exec'ing
<.> The name (or `Container ID`) of the running container where we want to run the command
<.> The command that we mean to run
