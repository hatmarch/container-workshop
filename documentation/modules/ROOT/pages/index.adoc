== Overview

This immersive workshop will introduce you to the world of Containers and Containerization.

The goals of this hands-on workshop is to give you a crash course introduction to containers, their many use cases and steps you can take to securely containerise your in-house applications.

Throughout this workshop, you will use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8) Container tools including Podman and Buildah which provide secure means of building and running containers.

== Red Hat Container History
Red Hat’s contributions to containers go back to the creation of those core container primitives of Linux namespaces and cGroups in the early 2000s.
Containers have been a core feature of Red Hat Enterprise Linux over multiple major releases and was the foundation of Red Hat OpenShift since its initial release in 2011.

Interest in containers technology continues to grow, as more organizations realize the benefits they can provide for how they manage applications and infrastructure.
But it’s easy to get lost in all the hype and forget what containers are really about. Ultimately, containers are a feature of Linux.
Containers have been a part of the Linux operating system for more than a decade, and go back even further in UNIX.
That’s why, despite the very recent introduction of Windows containers, the majority of containers we see are in fact Linux containers. That also means that if you’re deploying containers, your Linux choices matter a lot.

In Red Hat we say "Containers are Linux". If you think about it?

Container Security is Linux Security

Container Performance is Linux Performance
