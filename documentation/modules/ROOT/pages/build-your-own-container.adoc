= Build your own Secure Container
:navtitle: Build your own Secure Container

In this chapter we'll try to make the container image we've been using a bit more secure using a related tool to `podman`, namely `buildah`.

image::buildah.png[Buildah!,width=320,height=78]

`buildah` is used to create OCI-compliant container images, such as the `{apache-server-image-insecure-image}` that we've been using.  We'll start by fixing a the security vulnerability we found in the xref::containers-and-security.adoc[previous section].

== Buildah native commands

One of the things that makes `buildah` unique is the ability to interact with container images from the host's command line.  (As we'll see in the next section, it also allows the creation of images from a `Dockerfile` or, more generically a `Containerfile`).  This will make it easy for us to remediate the vulnerability we found in the last section.

Where we left off with our container image is that we needed to patch the bash package installed on the container

.Need to upgrade bash
image::security-bulletin.png[]

This can be problematic if our image does not already have installed on it all the tools (such as package management tools like `dnf` or `yum`) necessary to remediate the problem.  But with buildah's *native command functionality* this is no longer a problem.

. If you don't have one open already, open a terminal as a non-root user and confirm your user by running the following command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{USER}
----
+
. Next, as a non-root user we need to do some setup that will allow buildah to interact with the container in this native command mode.  Run the following in the terminal  
+
[NOTE]
====
The main reason for running this command is that we'll be mounting filesystems inside the container and non-root users normally do not have privileges to do this.  Running `buildah unshare` is a way of preparing to work with containers "rootlessly" (if you will).  For a discussion of what this is, see link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/buildah-unshare-command[here^].  Think of it as a way that buildah can work with container "rootlessly" just as podman did in the xref::containers-and-security.adoc#non_root_containers[last section, window=_blank]
====
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah unshare
----
+
. You should notice that upon running the command your terminal turns to look like a root terminal.  You are not actually root, but rather working within a "namespace" that makes you appear as root when it comes to interacting with buildah's containers
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[root@ansible-1 ~]# 
----
+
. Next we tell buildah to implicitly create a "working container" from our currently vulnerable image: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
CONTAINER=$(buildah from {apache-server-image-insecure-image}) #<.>
----
<.> We're effectively assigning a the shell variable `CONTAINER` to the id of the buildah container that starts with the state of the image we want to update
+
[NOTE]
====
If you haven't yet downloaded the image, the image might be downloaded first from the repo before you can enter the next command
====
+
. To confirm that our working container is up, we can run the following command (which is a little like `podman ps` but for "working containers")
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

----
+
. We can then use buildah to effectively mount the root of the container's filesystem
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

. Now that we have a mount point we can copy files from the host directly into the container.  In our case however, we want to use the host's package management tooling to install the updated bash package on the container pass:[{$CONTAINER}]. [#upgrade_bash]#Run# this command:

<.> We are telling dnf to install the latest available compatible version of bash for our container (i.e. at `--installroot`)
+
. You may see a few errors upon running this command.  They are non-critical.  In the output the key message you should see is
+
include::partial$dnf_output.adoc[]

. Now we will commit these changes to a new image locally on the host that we'll test.  We commit the changes with

=== Testing commited container

Now that we committed a new image, we can test this committed image

. Run the new container "rootlessly" in the terminal by running the following command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    -d \
    -p 8081:80/tcp \

    {apache-server-image-secure-image}
----
+
. Since our new container image is virtually identical to the original one (except for the new bash package) and we're forwarding the same ports we can now attempt to exploit the container again with the configuration from before
. If you don't still have the metasploit console open, then split the terminal and follow the instructions xref::containers-and-security.adoc#using_metasploit[here, window=_blank] to the point where the metasploit console is configured to target the container
. Next run the following command in the *metasploit* terminal
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
check
----
+
. And this should result in the following output
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
[*] 127.0.0.1:8081 - The target is #not# exploitable.

Congratulations!  You'd fixed the shellshock exploit

== Buildah and Containerfiles

Though we've fixed the issue with {apache-server-image-insecure} by using the `buildah` native command line tools to fix it, there are still other aspects of the container that could be addressed to make it more secure and less likely to need special privileges from the underlying operating system such as

* Not running as the root user (and thus the apache server not running as `root`)
* Not requiring a port < 1024.  Currently the apache server in the container images listens on port 80

What's more, we have no record of the step-by-step changes we've made to the container that we might store in revision control.  One (valid) option would be to store all the buildah cli commands we issued in a shell script.  However, container tools like `docker` have popularized the `Dockerfile` (or, more generically, `Containerfile`) way of defining new containers.  Let's investigate the {apache-server-image-insecure}'s `Containerfile` to see if we can address the points above

[#basic_containerfile]
=== Basic Containerfile

. To start, let's create a folder where we'll do the work of building our container.  Right click on the `container-workshop` folder in the explorer, select `New Folder`.  Name the new folder `secure-container`
+
image:new-folder.png[width=500]
image:create-container-folder.png[width=300]
+
. In a normal user terminal, change into this newly created directory
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd /home/{USER}/container-workshop/secure-container
----
+
. Next we're going to create a new Containerfile.  Right-click on the `secure-container` folder and select `New File`.
+
.New Containerfile
image:new-containerfile.png[]
+
. The Containerfile you just created should appear in the editor window.  We'll be slowly adding to this Containfile bit by bit
+
. Add the following lines to the containerfile
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7 #<.>
USER root #<.>
----
<.> `FROM` is the base container that this container will start from.  `ubi7` stands for "Universal Base Image".  It will serve as a secure basis for the rest of our container.  See information on ubi below
<.> `USER` indicates that we want to operate as the `root` user for all the commands that follow, until another `USER` directive is found
+
. To get a sense of what we've done, let's build a container from this Containerfile useing `buildah`.  Run the following command
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah bud \#<.>
  -f Containerfile \#<.>
  -t {apache-server-containerfile-image} \#<.>
  /home/{USER}/container-workshop/secure-container #<.>
----
<.> `bud` indicates that buildah should operate from a `Containerfile` (or `Dockerfile`)
<.> `-f` indicates a the name of the Containerfile that should be used (in this instance, the one that just created)
<.> `-t` names the tag that should be given to the resultant image
<.> The final parameter is the directory in which the command should be run
+
. You should see output something like this:

====
While Shellshock is by now an old CVE, this demonstrates more broadly the value of starting your container with one of Red Hat's Universal Base Images.  These images are updated every quarter, their internal packages patched by Red Hat to fix all known CVEs.  For more in depth information on the UBI program see link:https://developers.redhat.com/books/red-hat-universal-base-images-ubi?sc_cid=7013a0000026GuZAAU[here]

[#containerfile_run]
=== Running Commands in a Containerfile

Our image is a good start, but it doesn't yet have a webserver on it; this is something we're going to have to install.  As we've seen, the ubi base has `yum` installed in it.  So instead of using `buildah` native commands we can instead add directives to the Containerfile to `RUN` commands within the Container as it's being built.   

. If you are still in the container, exit it to get back to the {USER} terminal on the host instance
. From the IDE, add the highlighted lines to the Containerfile
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7 
USER root 

#RUN yum install -y httpd && yum update -y && yum clean all# #<.>
----
<.> The `RUN` directive allows us to run a command as the user currently selected by the `USER` directive.  In this instance we chain a bunch of yum commands together to install our httpd server, ensure that all our packages are up to date (there may have been CVE patches since the last publishing of the ubi base image), and cleanup any temporary files (as we don't want these bloating the size of our final image)
+
. Now from the terminal run the following command to build our container 
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_no_annotations.adoc[]
+
. This should yield output similarfootnote:[Packages that are upgraded by yum will vary based on which packages have been updated by Red Hat since the last published ubi image] to the following:
