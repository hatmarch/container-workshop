= Build your own Secure Container
:navtitle: Build your own Secure Container

In this chapter we'll try to make the container image we've been using a bit more secure using a related tool to `podman`, namely `buildah`.

image::buildah.png[Buildah!,width=320,height=78]

`buildah` is used to create OCI-compliant container images, such as the `{apache-server-image-insecure-image}` that we've been using.  We'll start by fixing a the security vulnerability we found in the link:containers-and-security.html?FOO=bar[previous section^].

[#buildah_native]
== Buildah native commands

One of the things that makes `buildah` unique is the ability to interact with container images from the host's command line.  (As we'll see in the next section, it also allows the creation of images from a `Dockerfile` or, more generically a " `Containerfile` ").  This will make it easy for us to remediate the vulnerability we found in the last section.

Where we left off with our container image is that we needed to patch the bash package installed on the container

.Need to upgrade bash
image::security-bulletin.png[]

This can be problematic if our image does not already have installed on it all the tools (such as package management tools like `dnf` or `yum`) necessary to remediate the problem.  But with buildah's *native command functionality* this is no longer a problem.

. If you don't have one open already, open a terminal as a non-root user and confirm your user by running the following command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{USER}
----
+
. Next, as a non-root user we need to do some setup that will allow buildah to interact with the container in this native command mode.  Run the following in the terminal  
+
[NOTE]
====
The main reason for running this command is that we'll be mounting filesystems inside the container and non-root users normally do not have privileges to do this.  Running `buildah unshare` is a way of preparing to work with containers "rootlessly" (if you will).  For a discussion of what this is, see link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/buildah-unshare-command[here^].  

Think of it as a way that `buildah` can work with container "rootlessly" just as `podman` did in the link:containers-and-security.html?{guide-query-string}#non_root_containers[last section^]

+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah unshare
----
+
. You should notice that upon running the command your terminal turns to look like a root terminal.  You are not actually root, but rather working within a "namespace" that makes you appear as root when it comes to interacting with buildah's containers
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[root@ansible-1 ~]# 
----
+
. Next we tell buildah to implicitly create a "working container" from our currently vulnerable image: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
CONTAINER=$(buildah from {apache-server-image-insecure-image}) #<.>
----
<.> We're effectively assigning a the shell variable `CONTAINER` to the id of the buildah container that starts with the state of the image we want to update
+
[NOTE]
====
If you haven't yet downloaded the image, the image might be downloaded first from the image registry before you can enter the next command
====
+
. To confirm that our working container is up, we can run the following command (which is a little like `podman ps` but for "working containers")
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

+
. We can then use buildah to effectively mount the root of the container's filesystem
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

----
<.> CONTAINER_MOUNT_POINT is getting set with the path to the mount in the host filesystem.  We store it in a shell variable because this tends to be a long path

. Now that we have a mount point we can copy files from the host directly into the container.  In our case however, we want to use the *host's* package management tooling to install the updated bash package on the container `pass:[${CONTAINER}]`. [#upgrade_bash]#Run# this command:

----
<.> dnf is the package management tool installed on your host instance.  The `-y` means that if dnf prompts the user, such as whether to install a given package, the answer will always be yes
<.> This tells dnf that the requested packages should be installed relative to this installroot (`pass:[${CONTAINER_MOUNT_POINT}]` and thus the root of the container) instead of '/', the root of the host instance
<.> We are telling dnf to install the latest available compatible version of bash for our container (i.e. at `--installroot`)
+
[NOTE]
====
You may see a few errors upon running the above command.  They are non-critical.  The important thing is that you see the highlighted section below in your own local output

+
. In the output the key message you should see is highlighted:
+

. Now we will commit these changes to a new image locally on the host that we'll test.  We commit the changes with

<.> This is the ID of the working container that we want saved as an image

=== Testing commited container

Now that we committed a new image, we can test this committed image

:stop-container-name: {apache-server-container-name}

. Run the new container "rootlessly" in the terminal by running the following command:

    {apache-server-image-secure-image}
----
<.> Since our new container image is virtually identical to the original one (except for the new bash package) and we're forwarding the same ports we can now attempt to exploit the container again with the configuration from before

include::partial$metasploit_shell_return.adoc[]
 
Next run the following command in the *metasploit* terminal (*{metasploit-terminal}*)

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
check
----

And this should result in the following output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
[*] 127.0.0.1:8081 - The target is #not# exploitable.
----
--
====

Congratulations!  You'd fixed the shellshock exploit of the original `{apache-server-image-insecure-image}` container!

.TIP
****
You are now done with metasploit and {metasploit-terminal}.  You can close down that terminal with the following commands:

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::
+
--

First exit out of metasploit

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----

Which should return you to the lab instance terminal

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[{USER}@ansible-1 ~]$
----

And now exit out of that terminal

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----

Which should return you terminal to a single "unsplit" terminal window

Next let's look at how we can make our container even more resilient against attack by using another popular way of building containers.
