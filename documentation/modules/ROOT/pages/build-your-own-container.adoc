= Build your own Secure Container
:navtitle: Build your own Secure Container

In this chapter we'll try to make the container image we've been using a bit more secure using a related tool to `podman`, namely `buildah`.

image::buildah.png[Buildah!,width=320,height=78]

`buildah` is used to create OCI-compliant container images, such as the `{apache-server-image-insecure-image}` that we've been using.  We'll start by fixing a the security vulnerability we found in the xref::containers-and-security.adoc[previous section].

[#buildah_native]
== Buildah native commands

One of the things that makes `buildah` unique is the ability to interact with container images from the host's command line.  (As we'll see in the next section, it also allows the creation of images from a `Dockerfile` or, more generically a " `Containerfile` ").  This will make it easy for us to remediate the vulnerability we found in the last section.

Where we left off with our container image is that we needed to patch the bash package installed on the container

.Need to upgrade bash
image::security-bulletin.png[]

This can be problematic if our image does not already have installed on it all the tools (such as package management tools like `dnf` or `yum`) necessary to remediate the problem.  But with buildah's *native command functionality* this is no longer a problem.

. If you don't have one open already, open a terminal as a non-root user and confirm your user by running the following command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{USER}
----
+
. Next, as a non-root user we need to do some setup that will allow buildah to interact with the container in this native command mode.  Run the following in the terminal  
+
[NOTE]
====
The main reason for running this command is that we'll be mounting filesystems inside the container and non-root users normally do not have privileges to do this.  Running `buildah unshare` is a way of preparing to work with containers "rootlessly" (if you will).  For a discussion of what this is, see link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/buildah-unshare-command[here^].  Think of it as a way that buildah can work with container "rootlessly" just as podman did in the xref::containers-and-security.adoc#non_root_containers[last section, window=_blank]
====
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah unshare
----
+
. You should notice that upon running the command your terminal turns to look like a root terminal.  You are not actually root, but rather working within a "namespace" that makes you appear as root when it comes to interacting with buildah's containers
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[root@ansible-1 ~]# 
----
+
. Next we tell buildah to implicitly create a "working container" from our currently vulnerable image: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
CONTAINER=$(buildah from {apache-server-image-insecure-image}) #<.>
----
<.> We're effectively assigning a the shell variable `CONTAINER` to the id of the buildah container that starts with the state of the image we want to update
+
[NOTE]
====
If you haven't yet downloaded the image, the image might be downloaded first from the repo before you can enter the next command
====
+
. To confirm that our working container is up, we can run the following command (which is a little like `podman ps` but for "working containers")

. Now that we have a mount point we can copy files from the host directly into the container.  In our case however, we want to use the host's package management tooling to install the updated bash package on the container `pass:[${CONTAINER}]`. [#upgrade_bash]#Run# this command:

[#buildah_containerfile]
== Buildah and Containerfiles

Though we've fixed the issue with {apache-server-image-insecure} by using the `buildah` native command line tools to fix it, there are still other aspects of the container that could be addressed to make it more secure and less likely to need special privileges from the underlying operating system such as

* Not running as the root user (and thus the apache server not running as `root`)
* Not requiring a port < 1024.  Currently the apache server in the container images listens on port 80

What's more, we have no record of the step-by-step changes we've made to the container that we might store in revision control.  One (valid) option would be to store all the buildah cli commands we issued in a shell script.  However, container tools like `docker` have popularized the `Dockerfile` (or, more generically, `Containerfile`) way of defining new containers.  Let's investigate the {apache-server-image-insecure}'s `Containerfile` to see if we can address the points above

[#basic_containerfile]
=== Basic Containerfile

. To start, let's create a folder where we'll do the work of building our container.  Right click on the `container-workshop` folder in the explorer, select `New Folder`.  Name the new folder `secure-container`
+
image:new-folder.png[width=500]
image:create-container-folder.png[width=300]

. Next we're going to create a new Containerfile.  Right-click on the `secure-container` folder and select `New File`.
+
.New Containerfile
image:new-containerfile.png[]
+
. The Containerfile you just created should appear in the editor window.  We'll be slowly adding to this Containfile bit by bit
+
. Add the following lines to the containerfile
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7 #<.>

----
<.> `FROM` is the base container that this container will start from.  `ubi7` stands for link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image["Universal Base Image"^].  It will serve as a secure basis for the rest of our container.  See more information on ubi below
<.> `USER` indicates that we want to operate as the `root` user for all the commands that follow, until another `USER` directive is found
+
. To get a sense of what we've done, let's build a container from this Containerfile useing `buildah`.  Run the following command
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

<.> The final parameter is the directory in which the command should be run

.Why didn't we have to patch bash
====
While Shellshock is by now an old CVE, this demonstrates more broadly the value of starting your container with one of Red Hat's Universal Base Images.  These images are updated every quarter, their internal packages patched by Red Hat to fix all known CVEs.  For more in depth information on the UBI program see link:https://developers.redhat.com/books/red-hat-universal-base-images-ubi?sc_cid=7013a0000026GuZAAU[here]
====

[#containerfile_run]
=== Running Commands in a Containerfile

Our image is a good start, but it doesn't yet have a webserver on it; this is something we're going to have to install.  As we've seen, the ubi base has `yum` installed in it.  So instead of using `buildah` native commands we can instead add directives to the Containerfile to `RUN` commands within the Container as it's being built.   

. If you are still in the container, exit it to get back to the {USER} terminal on the host instance
. From the IDE, add the highlighted lines to the Containerfile
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7 
USER root 

#RUN yum install -y httpd && yum update -y && yum clean all# #<.>
----
<.> The `RUN` directive allows us to run a command as the user currently selected by the `USER` directive.  In this instance we chain a bunch of yum commands together to install our httpd server, ensure that all our packages are up to date (there may have been CVE patches since the last publishing of the ubi base image), and cleanup any temporary files (as we don't want these bloating the size of our final image)
+
. Now from the terminal run the following command to build our container 
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_no_annotations.adoc[]
+
. This should yield output similarfootnote:[Packages that are upgraded by yum will vary based on which packages have been updated by Red Hat since the last published ubi image] to the following:
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_output_run.adoc[]
+
. Let's see if this image has a webserver running now.  Run the following command in the terminal
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    -d \
    -p 8081:80/tcp \ 
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-containerfile-image} \
    /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND #<.>
----
<.> As we did above with `bash`, we are now wanting to run `httpd` as the root process of {apache-server-containerfile-image} and this time we're providing that command the `-DFOREGROUND` argument
+
. Open you're Browser Preview window and navigate to `localhost:8081` and you should see a familiar sight (or site, if you will)
+
image::apache-test-page.png[]
+
. This is encouraging, but we don't yet have the non-boilerplate aspects of our site in the container.  For instance, if we navigate to our rudimentary guestbook functionality at `localhost:8081/hello.html`
+
.Guestbook functionality does not exist in the container
image::guestbook-not-found.png[]
+
. We'll address this problem in the next section.  For now, let's stop and remove this container by running the following
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rm -f {apache-server-container-name}
----

[#containerfile_copy]
=== Copying files into the container

So we're got a container image that is able to run a generic apache site, but how do we customize this to run our specific site.  This is where another Container file directive, `COPY` comes in.  In this section we're going to get a little help from the builah native commands to retrieve our custom content.  Then we're going to show how we can use `COPY` and the Containerfile to get those assets onto our container

. First let's leverage `buildah` to pull our custom website files onto our host.  We'll need to mount the container and since we're not a root user we're going to first need to issue
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah unshare
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[root@ansible-1 ~]# 
----
+
. Next we'll run the next few commands to mount the old insecure container
+
[NOTE]
====
Normally a team would already have custom content handy on the host already.  In this instance we're wanting to show off `buildah` a little more but it is a reasonably typical practice to copy files from one container image to another, particularly in build scenarios where assets are built in one container and copied to another.  This use case is out of the scope of this workshop however.
====
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
WORKING_CONTAINER_OLD=$(buildah from {apache-server-image-insecure-image}) 
WORKING_CONTAINER_OLD_IMAGE_MOUNT=$(buildah mount pass:[${WORKING_CONTAINER_OLD}])
----
+
. Now we don't want very many files from the old container, we only want the files involved with guestbook.  We can pull them out and into our `Containerfile` working directory by running the following commands
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cp pass:[${WORKING_CONTAINER_OLD_IMAGE_MOUNT}]/var/www/cgi-bin/log-visitor.sh /home/{USER}/container-workshop/secure-container
cp pass:[${WORKING_CONTAINER_OLD_IMAGE_MOUNT}]/var/www/html/hello.html /home/{USER}/container-workshop/secure-container
----
+
. At this point you should see the two files appear in the `secure-container` directory.  You can also click on them and take a look at the (simple) HTML and bash code
+
image::guestbook-files.png[]
+
. Now that we've retrieved the files, we can exit the `buildah unshare` sesssion
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[{USER}@ansible-1 ~]pass:[$] 
----
+
. Next, open the `Containerfile` in the IDE (if it's not open already) and add the highlighted lines
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7 
USER root 

RUN yum install -y httpd && yum update -y && yum clean all

#COPY hello.html /var/www/html# #<.>
#COPY log-visitor.sh /var/www/cgi-bin# 
#RUN chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/log-visitor.sh# #<.>
----
<.> The `COPY` directive moves files from the current working directory on the host and copies them to the specified location in the container image (in this case `/var/www/html`).  This is analogous to what we did before with the `buildah mount` commands
<.> To ensure our cgi-bin script has execute privileges it's generally good practice to use a `RUN` directive to use the `chmod` command to ensure this. 
+
. Rebuild the container with the `buildah bud` command again:
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_no_annotations.adoc[]
+
. This should yield output similar to before but appended with the following (... represents content that has been omitted)
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_output_copy.adoc[]
+
. Now let's see if this is enough to run our site
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    -d \
    -p 8081:80/tcp \ 
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-containerfile-image} \
    /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND 
----
+
. Once the container is running, if you navigate to `localhost:8081/hello.html` you should now see the guestbook
+
.Guestbook restored
image::apache-guestbook-page.png[]
+
. Go ahead and "sign" the guestbook by entering your name (such as Alice) and hit `Submit`.  You should be greeted with a page like this
+
image::guestbook-more-secure-container.png[]
+
. Of note is that this time the httpd server is running as the `apache` user and not `root` (see highlight in image)
+
[NOTE]
.Why is the webserver running as `apache`?
====
Given that our `Containerfile` is running as `root` (per the last `USER` directive) you might be wondering why the webserver is running as `apache`.  This is because the httpd package that is installed from `yum` defaults to running as apache, regardless of the user that executes the `/usr/sbin/httpd` command
====

At this point our container image is looking pretty good.  Aside from the volume mount (so that our guestbook can be persisted between runs) things are looking pretty good.  However, there are still additional steps we take to make this image even more resilient to attack or exploit.  Here are two issues:

* The web server is running on port 80 in the container.  This is a privileged port.  Better to have this run at port run in an privileged port above 1024 (such as 8080)
* Running as a specific user can be problematic as that user can implicitly have privileges afforded to them via sudo (either at runtime or in the ongoing maintenance of the container).  It would be better if we could run the container as the unknown or "anonymous" user

We'll address both of these concerns in the next section.  For now, as before, let's stop and remove this container by running the following

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rm -f {apache-server-container-name}
----

[#no_privilege]
=== Running as an "Arbitrary User"

To futher limit the attack surface of containers, Kubernetes products such as OpenShift by default run containers with an arbitrarily assigned user.  This effectively overrides the `USER` directive of the `Containerfile`.  Explanation and reasons for this can be found link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4859371[here^].  

When a container is run with an arbitrary user, the only thing that we are guaranteed is that the user will be part of the `root` group.  This fact will become important in a minute.  First let's take a look at what happens to the container when we run as a random user and fix the issues in the `Containerfile` as they arise

. We can already run our container image with an arbitrary user using the `-u` flag with `podman run`.  Let's attempt to run our container (but this time without the `-d` flag so that we can see the output right away)
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    --rm \

    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-containerfile-image} \
    /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND 
----

The issue here is that by default an arbitrary user won't have access to most of the files that the webserver needs to run.  This is where the fact that our arbitrary user will always be part of the `root` group (gid: 0) will come in handy.  We need to make sure that the root group is assigned to the files and folders that the webserver needs and that the group has appropriate permissions.

The process for doing this might be one of trial and error if you're not familiar with the software that you're attempting to run in the container.  In this case we know exactly which directories need to be adjusted.  Let's return to the `Containerfile`

. Open the `Containerfile` and add the following lines (highlighted) to it

So the issue here is something that we assumed we would need to change, namely, that the webserver is attempting to bind to a privileged port.  Since we're no longer running the command as root this is not possible.  This highlights another issue that you might run into trying to support arbitrary containers in your containers: you might need to change the configuration of the service that you're attempting to containerize.  

For our apache webserver we're going to need to change its default configuration file.  Normally this is done by having our configuration on the host, editing it to our liking there, and using the `COPY` directive to replace the default configuration in the container.

. First let's use buildah's native commands to pull the `httpd.conf` file out of our image and into our working folder.  Run the following command in the terminal:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
buildah unshare
WORKING_CONTAINER=$(buildah from {apache-server-containerfile-image})
WORKING_CONTAINER_MOUNT=$(buildah mount pass:[${WORKING_CONTAINER}])
cp pass:[${WORKING_CONTAINER_MOUNT}]/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /home/{USER}/container-workshop/secure-container
exit

----
+
. When the commands finish you should have a copy of the httpd.conf from the image in the `container-workshop` directory (you might need to refresh the explorer first).  Click on the httpd.conf to edit it in VSCode
+
image::httpd-conf.png[]
+
. Find the `Listen` directive near the start of the `httpd.conf` and change it to match the highlighted line so that the server listens on port 8080
+
[.console-input]
[source,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
#
ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
# Listen 12.34.56.78:80
#Listen 8080#

#
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
----
+
. OPTIONAL: Given that our server will not be started by the root user, there is no need to define a user and group the server should run as.  Remove (or comment out) the lines that are struckthrough in your `httpd.conf`
+
[subs="+macros,+specialchars,+quotes"]
----
#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  
#
# User/Group: The name (or pass:[#]number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
# It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
# running httpd, as with most system services.
#
[.line-through]#User apache#
[.line-through]#Group apache#

# 'Main' server configuration

+
. Now with the configuration updated, we need to once again update our `Containerfile` with the highlighted lines

=== Additional Containerfile Commands

Our container is in pretty good shape, but it's a little annoying that we have to specify a command every time, for instance, what's highlighted here:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
podman run \
    --rm \
    -u pass:[$((1000 + ${RANDOM}))] \
    -p 8081:8080/tcp \#<.>
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-containerfile-image} \
    #/usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND#
----

For this we can add a directive to our `Containerfile` called `CMD` which tells the container runtime which command should be executed to start the containerfootnote:[There is another similar directive called `ENTRYPOINT`.  You can read more about `ENTRYPOINT` and its interaction with `CMD` link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[here^]]

The other thing that would be good to advertise is the port that the container listens on at runtime (now 8080).  There is a directive for this as well called `EXPOSE`.  This does not actually publish the port but rather serves as documentation between the person who builds the image and those that run it (or, as we'll see, a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes)

. Let's finish off our container by adding the following highlighted lines to our `Containerfile`:
+
[.console-input]
[source,Containerfile,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----

#EXPOSE 8080/tcp# #<.>

USER 1001

----
<.> as with port forwarding in `podman run` we can specify the protocol (tcp)
<.> This is the same command we were running manually with podman run

. Build the container
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_no_annotations.adoc[]
+
. This should yield output similar to before but appended with the following (... represents content that has been omitted)
+
include::partial$buildah_bud_output_cmd.adoc[]
+
. Run [#finished_container]#the container# again to test it (notice the differences in the command)
+
[.console-input]

----
podman run \
    --rm \
    -d \
    -P \#<.>
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-containerfile-image}
----
<.> the `-P` flag leverages the `EXPOSE` directives from the `Containerfile` and forwards all exposed ports to *random* ports on the host
+
. You'll notice that we can no longer hit the webserver at port 8081 (or it's at least very unlikely that we can) and instead we need to find out the port that podman assigned on the host.  Capture that with this command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
HOST_PORT=$(podman ps \#<.>
    -f name={apache-server-container-name} \#<.>
    --format json | jq -r ".[0].Ports[0].hostPort") #<.>
----
<.> The output of this string of commands will give us the port on the host that is forwarded to our exposed container port
<.> This returns only information for containers with the name `{apache-server-container-name}`
<.> `--format` returns extended information in JSON format which we pipe to the `jq` command to quickly parse the JSON for the field we're after
+
. Next, we're pretty-print the url of our guestbook so that we can paste it into our Browser Preview window
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "http://localhost:pass:[${HOST_PORT}]/hello.html"
----
+
. Copy the echo'ed string into the Browser Preview window
+
[TIP]
====
If you hover over the string in the terminal window with your mouse you might be prompted to kbd:[CTRL]-click (or kbd:[CMD]-click on Mac OSX) to open the link in your browser.  *This will not work* because it will open the URL in your browser instead of in the Browser Preview of your VSCode host instance.
