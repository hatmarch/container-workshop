_5 MINUTE EXERCISE_


[#intro_code_server]
== 1. Introduction to Code Server
You will have received a login page like below to register for the workshop. Once registered you will receive username and password where you have been given access to a RHEL 8 virtual machine.

Your access to the machine will be mediated by link:https://github.com/cdr/code-server[code-server,window=_blank]: a browser based community version of Visual Studio Code.

Let's take a moment to familiarize yourself with the environment

[#open_code_server]
== 2. Open code server

Once you have entered your password, you will be greeted with the code-server UI with your RHEL user's (`{USER}`) home directory.

[#open_code_server_terminal]
== 3. Open Terminal

Among other things, your code-server gives you command line access to your RHEL instance.  You can open the terminal by using kbd:[CTRL+ J] (or kbd:[CMD+J] on a Mac)

The first time you open it, you will find your terminal at the bottom (right) of the screen. At some points during the exercises you will need
two screens and from the dropdown menu you can elect to have split terminals as shown above.

[#open_code_server_terminal_commands]
== 4. Issuing Terminal Commands

Just to see that you are logged into the server, issue the following command

[NOTE]

[#local_browser]
== 5. Local Browser

Your code-server instance also has a chromium based browser installed (as a VSCode extension).  This will allow us to view html files and connect to VM local services that are not otherwise exposed to the internet at large.
