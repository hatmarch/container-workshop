= Introduction to Code Server

You have been given access to a RHEL8 virtual machine and your access to the machine will be mediated by link:https://github.com/cdr/code-server[code-server]: a browser based community version of Visual Studio Code.

Let's take a moment to familiarize yourself with the environment

== Open code server

Once you have entered your password, you will be greeted with the code-server UI with your RHEL user's (`{USER}`) home directory.

== Open Terminal

Among other things, your code-server gives you command line access to your RHEL instance.  You can open the terminal by using kbd:[CTRL+ J] (or kbd:[CMD+J] on a Mac)

The first time you open it, you will find your terminal at the bottom (right) of the screen, as shown below

== Issuing Terminal Commands

Just to see that you are logged into the server, issue the following command

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{USER}
----

Next check the distribution of Linux that is being run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat /etc/os-release 
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
