= Introduction to Code Server

You have been given access to a RHEL8 virtual machine and your access to the machine will be mediated by link:https://github.com/cdr/code-server[code-server]: a browser based community version of Visual Studio Code.

Let's take a moment to familiarize yourself with the environment

[#open_code_server]
== Open code server

Once you have entered your password, you will be greeted with the code-server UI with your RHEL user's (`{USER}`) home directory.

[#open_code_server_terminal]
== Open Terminal

Among other things, your code-server gives you command line access to your RHEL instance.  You can open the terminal by using kbd:[CTRL+ J] (or kbd:[CMD+J] on a Mac)

The first time you open it, you will find your terminal at the bottom (right) of the screen, as shown below

[#open_code_server_terminal_commands]
== Issuing Terminal Commands

Just to see that you are logged into the server, issue the following command

[NOTE]
====
The first time you try to copy and paste the commands below your browser may prompt you with a window like this:

[#local_browser]
== Local Browser

Your code-server instance also has a chromium based browser installed (as a VSCode extension).  This will allow us to view html files and connect to VM local services that are not otherwise exposed to the internet at large.
