= Running your First Container with Podman

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_


In this exercise we're going to use Podman to download and run a container that will run a local Apache webserver on your VM.

image::podman.svg[Podman!,width=320,height=86]

[#run_container]
== 1. Add a website by running a container

. First let's prove that Apache is not currently running on your local VM.
+
. In your xref:introduction.adoc#local_browser[Local Browser,window=_blank], navigate to `localhost:8081`, which instructs the browser to connect to port 8081 of your local instance
+
. You should find that there is nothing there but a blank screen
+
image::empty-browser-preview.png[]

Now we're going to use podman to quickly create a running website on this instance!  

[TIP]
====
At this point we're going to be using our *code-server Terminal* to issue a number of commands.  If you're unfamiliar how to access the code-server terminal, see this section xref:introduction.adoc#open_code_server_terminal[here, window=_blank]
====

. Login as `root` on your instance by running the following command in the code-server Terminal:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sudo -i
----
+
. You should now see the terminal prompt change to `#` indicating that you are now `root`
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs=""]
----
[root@ansible-1 ~]#
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Some of you with a security background are [#security_vuln]#probably fairly uncomfortable with this#.  Don't worry: there's a method to our madness!  While you might feel an aversion to running commands as the `root` user on the instance, it's worth pointing out that any socket-based container runtimes (such as `Docker`) require some sort of root access to operate
====
+
. From inside the terminal, run the following command (see the footnotes for the breakdown of the different elements of the command):
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \#<.>
    --privileged \#<.>
    -d \#<.>
    -p 8081:80/tcp \#<.> 
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \#<.>
    {apache-server-image-insecure} #<.>
----
<.> The `podman` command has a number of subcommands.  `run` indicates that we want to run a given container image
<.> The `--privileged` flag, as we'll come to see, could be problematic.  It allows the container to run with an extended set of capabilities that might otherwise be reserved for the host (such as accessing ports < 1024).  However, when running some processes in a container, this is sometimes required
<.> Run the container in "daemon" mode (i.e. in the background) 
<.> This indicates that we want local (i.e. the host) port 8081 forwarded to port 80 in the container
<.> Whilst we can always refer to started containers by their system assigned Id, the `--name` option gives us the ability to refer to the container by a human-friendly name instead
<.> This is the name of the image (including the image registry where the container is normally located, in this case link:quay.io[quay.io]) that we want to run
+
. After the image is "pulled" you should see something like the following in the terminal which represents the id of the running container
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Trying to pull {apache-server-image-insecure}...
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob b5f2e1583bc1 done  
Copying config 68f54f9c95 done  
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
{container-id-long} #<.>
----
<.> This is the id of the running container.  
+
. Compare the id there to the output of the following `podman` command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman ps
----
+
. You should see in the output something like the following that shows you that the container is running
+
.NOTE: notice that the beginning of the CONTAINER ID matches the id the was output from the `podman run` command
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::partial$podman_ps.adoc[]
----
{zwsp} +
+
. Finally, return to the Browser Preview panel and hit the reload button.  You should see the following web page indicating that an Apache webserver is running:
+
.Test Page
image::apache-test-page-trimmed.png[]
+
. Our website has more than a test page, it also has a visitor form (like straight out of the 90s!).  Let's take a look by navigating to this address (use the copy button to copy the URL and paste it into the Browser Preview panel): 
+
[.console-input]
[source,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
http://localhost:8081/hello.html
----
+
{zwsp} +
. You should see something like this: 
+
image::apache-guestbook-page.png[]
+
. Now enter a name into the `Name:` field to be logged to the guestbook and press the `Log to Guestbook` button.  You should now be presented a screen like this: 
+
image::apache-guestbook-submit.png[]
+
. Click the `here` link highlighted above to go back and enter another name
{zwsp}

Now that we have a container up and running, let's poke around inside the container to get some idea of what's going on and how containers relate to the host instance.

[#enter_container]
== 2. Look inside a running container

Whilst the container is running, we are able to "look inside" the container.  The experience is much the same to `telnet` ing or `ssh` ing into a remote instance or virtual machine.

. First though, let's record what's going on with the container's host, namely the virtual machine that is running your code-server instance.  We'll use this to compare to what we find inside the container.  Run the following command in the terminal to gather some intel about the host (and save it to a place where code-server can display it!)
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::partial$gather_info.adoc[]
----
+
{zwsp} +
. Next, let's use the VS Code editor to see what our command found out.  Use kbd:[CTRL+o] (or kbd:[CMD+o] on a Mac) to show the "Open File" dialog.  Type the name of the file we wrote out to in the dialog (that is `{temp-filepath}`)
+
.Open File Or Folder dialog
image::file-or-folder-dialog.png[]
+
{zwsp} +
. This should open the file in the left editor pane.  The output should look something like the following
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$gather_info_example_output.txt[]
----
+
{zwsp} +
. Now let's get into the container so that we can run the same command.
+
Remember how we used the `--name` option when we ran our container?  Now we can use this to indicate to podman which container we want to `exec` into:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman exec \
   -it \#<.>
   {apache-server-container-name} \
   /bin/bash #<.>
----
include::partial$podman_exec_callouts.adoc[]
+
{zwsp} +
. If you have been able to `exec` into the container successfully, you should see the following in the terminal
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[root@4e9c38ac10eb /]# #<.>
----
<.> Notice that the `CONTAINER_ID` appears after the `@` in the bash shell that we have started inside the container
+
. Now let's run our command from before _but this time we're running it from "within" the container_
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::partial$gather_info.adoc[]
----
+
. Notice that the editor window didn't change even though we wrote the info to the same location.  The difference is that the location is *local to the container*.  That's because the container has a filesystem that appears separate to the host
+
. To make sure the file was created, run the following command to show output of the file that we just created in the container:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat {temp-filepath}
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

---------

OS Version:
----------

VERSION="7.9 (Maipo)"
... #<.>
----
<.> There's a lot more lines that have been truncated

It would be nice if we could easily compare the information we collected from inside the container with the information we collected from the host.  For this, we can copy the data out of the container.

[#copy_data]
== 3. Copying data out of a container

Let's see just how different the two files are by doing a `diff` on them.  And for this we'd like to use the builtin code-server support for this.  To do this we can draw on another methapor with real hosts or virtual instances, the notion of `ftp` ing or `scp` ing files.

. First let's "log out" of the container
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----
+
[NOTE]
====
_We're not really logging out as much as we're causing the process that we `podman exec` ed to stop thus ending the `podman exec` command and returning us to the host's terminal_
====
+
{zwsp}
. Next, run this command to copy the file out of the container and into the tmp drive of the host instance (Those that have used `scp` will probably find the format familiar)
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman cp \
  {apache-server-container-name}:{temp-filepath} \#<.>
  {container-info-filepath} #<.>
----
<.> The `{apache-server-container-name}:<path>` indicates that the `path` is inside the container (i.e. container filesystem) that we named with the `--name` option at the time we issued the `podman run` command
<.> This path, undecorated by a container name or id, indicates that we are referencing a path on the host (i.e. local filesystem)
+
{zwsp} +
Now click anywhere within the left editor where the `{temp-file}` should still be open to give that editor focus.
+
{zwsp} +
. With the `{temp-file}` still in focus, hit kbd:[SHIFT+CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+CTRL+p] on a Mac) to open the *Command Palette* and start typing `compare` so that you can select the command `File: Compare Active File With...`
+
image::compare-command.png[]
+
{zwsp} +
. Then type `{container-info-filepath}` in the next dialog that pops up until the file is selectable.  Then click on it.
+
image::container-info-select.png[]
+
{zwsp} +
. You should then see a screen like the following.  Take a minute to consider the differences
+
[TIP]
====
If the comparison document seems to cramped, you can double-click on the tab of the comparison (circled in red in the image below) to expand the size of it out to be easier to read (e.g. it will compress the Browser Preview window to the right).

Double-click the tab again to restore it to its original size

.Host vs. Container output of above commands

. Finally, let's look at our guestbook visitor log in VSCode by copying the visitor guestbook to our local VM
+
include::partial$copy_visitor_info.adoc[]
+
{zwsp} +
. You should now see the file appear in your *Explorer*.  Click on it to view the contents.  It should match the visitors that you entered previously
+
image::visitor-info.png[Visitor Info]
+ 
. Having looked at the contents of `visitor_info.txt` let's delete our copy from off the host by right-clicking on it in the Explorer and selecting `Delete Permanently`
+
image::delete-permanently.png[]

[#stop_container]
== 4. Stopping the Container (and Apache server)

Before we continue, let's stop the container that is running in the background (thanks to the `-d` flag)

. Let's stop the container
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman stop {apache-server-container-name} #<.>
----
<.> `{apache-server-container-name}` is the name we gave the container (with the `--name` option) when we started it
+
.TIP
****
You can stop a container by its name or container id.. Alternatively, you can use this command to find and kill any container that reports as `UP`

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman stop $(podman ps -a | grep Up | cut -d" " -f1)
----
****
+
{zwsp} +
. If you were successful in stopping the container, you should see the following output: 
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{container-id-long}#<.>
----
<.> This will match the `CONTAINER ID` of any running container that was stopped
+
{zwsp} +
. Confirm that the container is stopped by hitting refresh in the Browser Preview.  You should again see a blank page as there is not longer anything listening on port 8081
+
{zwsp} +
. We can also see that the container is no longer listed when we run `podman ps`
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman ps
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

[#committing_containers]
== 5. Committing Containers to Images

Even though our **container is stopped, it's still around**! You might wonder why we would want to keep a container around even after we have stopped it.  Turns out it has to do with the fact that we might want to **create a new image from the container we've just run**.

Containers are by their nature immutable.  While they are running, however, changes are being made to their file systems.  When containers are stopped, we might want to **commit** those changes that were made to the filesystem whilst running.
{zwsp}
{zwsp}

[NOTE]
====
For those from an operations background, it's a little like creating an image snapshot from a Virtual Machine when its stopped.  That image can then be used to boot up a different VM in a desired state quickly.

====
{zwsp}

With `podman` the command is `commit`. Let's issue the command now; we'll see some of the value in it <<rerunning_container,a little later on in the lab>>.


. First let's find the stopped container using this variant of the `podman ps` command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman ps -a #<.>
----
<.> The `-a` stands for "all" which means "show containers regardless of state"
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
4e9c38ac10eb  {apache-server-image-insecure}  /usr/sbin/httpd -...  10 minutes ago  Exited (0) 2 minutes ago  0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp  {apache-server-container-name}
----
+
{zwsp} +
. As we can see from the output, the container has been exited and is just waiting there in the state it was in when it was stopped (2 minutes ago according to the output above)
+
{zwsp} +
. Now let's create an image from that container by _committing_ it:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman commit \
   {apache-server-container-name} \#<.>
   {apache-committed-container-image} #<.>
----
<.> This is the name of the container that we have stopped.  This could also be done by `CONTAINER ID`
<.> This is the name that we want to give the container **image**.  We can then treat this like any other container image
+
[NOTE]
====
For more info on committing container state, see the link:http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-commit.1.html[podman documentation,window=blank]
====
+
{zwsp} +
. This should yield output similar to the following:
+
include::partial$podman_commit_output.adoc[]
+
{zwsp} +
. And now let's see what images are available by issuing the following command to show all the images we podman knows about locally:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman images
----
+
{zwsp} +
. The command should yield output that looks something like the following
+
include::partial$podman_images_output.adoc[]


[#remove_containers]
== 6. Removing Containers

Having looked at the images on our system, let's turn our attention back to the containers that are running (or more accurately in our case, stopped)

{zwsp}

. To really tidy things up we need to tell `podman` to _remove_ the container.  Issue this command: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rm {apache-server-container-name}
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{container-id-long}#<.>
----
<.> As with `podman stop`, this will match the `CONTAINER ID` of any running container that was removed as a result of the command
+
[TIP]
====
As with the other `podman` commands, it's possible to remove containers by container id.

----
podman rm {CONTAINER_ID}
----

====
+
{zwsp} +
. And now finally we can prove that the container is gone:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman ps -a
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND  CREATED  STATUS  PORTS   NAMES
----

[#rerunning_container]
== 7. "Re-running" Containers

Let's say we want to take a look at our visitor_info.txt file that we copied out of the container and have since deleted from the host.  Let's start up our container to try to do that again

. Execute the following command (which should be familar from earlier in this section) 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    --privileged \
    -d \
    -p 8081:80/tcp \  
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    {apache-server-image-insecure} 
----
+
{zwsp} +
. Now attempt let's attempt to copy visitor_info.txt out of the container again
+
include::partial$copy_visitor_info.adoc[]
+
{zwsp} +
. But you'll get an error message.  There is no visitor_info.txt in this container!
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Error: "/var/log/www/visitor_info.txt" could not be found on container {apache-server-container-name}: No such file or directory
----

{zwsp}

Before we through our hands up in disgust, remember that we had the foresight of _committing_ our previously running web server container to a new image called `{apache-committed-container-image}`.  This image should container all the changes we made on top of the `{apache-server-container-name}` that we just ran and allow us access to the info that does not exist in the `{apache-server-image-insecure}`.

{zwsp}

. Let's stop and remove the current `{apache-server-image-insecure}` image based web server
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman stop -a #<.>
podman rm -a
----
<.> In both cases the `-a` indicates that we want to `stop` and `rm` (respectively) all containers
+
{zwsp} +
. Next, let's re-run our webserver, but this time from <<Committing Containers to Images,the image we created when we committed it>> from our first instance of `{apache-server-container-name}`:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
   --privileged \
   -d \
   -p 8081:80/tcp \
   --name {apache-server-container-name} \
   localhost/{apache-committed-container-image} #<.>
----
<.> We append `localhost` onto any image name that we didn't explicitly provide a registry (e.g. link:quay.io[`quay.io`]) for
+
{zwsp} +
. With our committed container running, let's attempt to restore our `{guestbook-record-file}` by pulling it out of the container running based on the committed image by issuing the same command as before
+
include::partial$copy_visitor_info.adoc[]
+
{zwsp} +
. Now our visitor info should be restored to the way it was when we last stopped the container (as verified by opening it in code-server)
+
.`{guestbook-record-file}` restored
image::visitor-info.png[]

But what good are containers if we can never _persist_ changes we've made with them without all this stopping and committing them?  Let's look to the next section to see if there is something else that can be done.

ifdef::extended-content[]
{zwsp}
[NOTE]
====
Podman also has a really cool feature to help you manage your container apps with Systemd (the system and service manager for Linux).
When you add your containers as units into Systemd, you can treat them just like any other service.
Check out the output from the following command
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman generate systemd --new --name {apache-server-container-name}
----

The following steps would generate and install, enable and start the service, so that everytime you reboot the container would start.
----
podman generate systemd --new --name {container-name}  > /etc/systemd/system/{container-name}.service
systemctl list-unit-files | grep {container-name}
systemctl enable {container-name}
systemctl start {container-name}
