= Container Security

If you looking to run containers in any kind of production capacity, simply knowing _how_ to run a container is not enough.  Ensuring that the container is _secure_ is as critical as making sure any production facing infrastructure is secure.

Sometimes people can be lulled into a false sense of security around containers because of the sense that they are isolated from the host (e.g. VM). However, in the previous sections we made allowances to get our containers up and running, some of which xref:podman-intro.adoc#security_vuln[we highlighted previously].

[#exploit_containers]
== Exploiting a Vulnerable Container

In order to get a sense of how consequential these security exploits can be, let's exploit some of the issues in the containers we already have running

image:shellshock-logo.png[role=right,width=50]
Our `{apache-server-image-insecure}` has a huge vulnerability in it that is further excerbated by the manner in which we've run our container.  The vulnerability is the (in)famous link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)[Shellshock vulnerability^] 

. First ensure the `{apache-server-image-insecure}` is running by running the following command in the terminal
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman ps
----
+
. You should see output something like below.  If you don't, then run the container as per link:container-persistence.html?USER={USER}&CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN={CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}#podman_run_httpd[here^]
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::partial$podman_ps.adoc[]
----

[#using_metasploit]
=== Using Metasploit

We're going to use a tool called link:https://www.metasploit.com/[metasploit] (which has already been installed on your VM instance) to exploit the vulnerability (with alarming ease).  

// This is common to the metasploit_setup_standalone page
include::partial$metasploit_setup.adoc[]

To ensure everything's setup right, we can check whether our setup is currently targeting a vulnerable container

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

Which should report the following output if successful: 

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[+] 127.0.0.1:8081 - The target is vulnerable.
----

.TIP
****
If you get a message that the target is not vulnerable (and you are expecting it to be, make sure the `{apache-server-image-insecure}` is running
****

====


[#exploit_shellshock]
=== Exploiting Shellshock

Now it's time to exploit our running container.  This is as simple as running the following inside the metasploit console (it causes the `multi/http/apache_mod_bash_env_exec` module to be run with the configuration we set up in the previous section)

include::partial$metasploit_exploit_shell.adoc[]

[#wreaking_havoc]
=== Wreaking havoc from within the container

Now that we're in the container, let's show the kind of vulnerabilities we've exposed.  

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::
+
--
. First, notice the user we're running as: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
root
----
+
. So we're running as the `root` user inside the container.  This is because we ran our container as root and setup our apache server to run as whichever user started the `httpd` process (in this case, `root`).
. Now let's take a look at where we are in the container by issuing these two commands and reviewing the output (yours might vary slightly):
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
pwd && ls -l
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
/var/www/cgi-bin
total 4
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 452 May 28 03:24 log-visitor.sh
----
+
. This is the script that logs visitors in our guestbook.  And notice that as root we have access to this script.  Feel free to look at the script 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat log-visitor.sh
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
include::example$log-visitor.sh[]
----
+
. Notice that the logbook directory is specified in the shell script.  We'll go there next.  But in the meantime we can damage the container by deleting the script
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
rm -f log-visitor.sh
----
--
====

Now if you try navigate to the guestbook at the following URL in the *Preview Browser* 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
http://localhost:8081/hello.html
----

.The guestbook might now work so well anymore...
image::apache-guestbook-page.png[]

and enter a name into the Name: field and press the `Log to Guestbook` button you will get an error

image::broken-guestbook.png[]

[NOTE]
.Ability to impact or sabotage running container
====
So far we've just impacted the running container.  To fix it we could just startup a new one.  But the vulnerabilities don't end there
====

[#wreaking_havoc_host]
=== Wreaking havoc on the Host

One key consideration when running containers as a given user is that this generally maps directly to a user on the host operating system.  As we'll see, this is particularly dangerous for a user such as `root` which exists on every system and has elevated privileges.  One of the places of "interaction" between the container and the host operating system where we can exploit this is via the *volume mounts* we were using

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::

. From within the same metasploit shell, let's poke around the directory where visitors were getting logged

. This is particularly concerning as you'll notice that this mirrors the files you see in the `container-workshop` directory of your host (as you can verify from the **Explorer**)
.  What's worse is that you are `root` so you can mess with stuff now in this directory (and below) of *the host system*.  For instance, enter the following commands:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo "You've been hax0red" >> visitor_info.txt && chmod a+w visitor_info.txt

[NOTE]
.Access to host filesystem via volume mounts
====
This demonstrates that a malicious intruder could actually read and change files on the host system, provided access was afforded them through our volume mounts.  But it gets even worse in this case because of our use of the `privileged` flag.  This gives the container OS level capabilities, which we'll exploit to potentially devestating effect next

[#run_containers_responsibly]
== Running containers responsibly

Following the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[principle of least privilege^], there is a lot we could have done to limit the damage of any attacker such as:

* xref:SECURITY:containers-and-security.adoc#privileged_containers[don't run privileged containers,window=_blank]
* xref:SECURITY:containers-and-security.adoc#se_linux[use SELinux to fine tune container access to volume mounts,window=_blank]
* don't run containers as root
* ensure that your containers do not include known vulnerabilities or CVEs

For the purposes of this lab, we're only going to investigate the last two items on this list.  

[TIP]
====
If you'd like to go deeper on the first two points, follow the links provided in the bullet points above
====

[#non_root_containers]
=== Non-root containers

Most containerization runtimes, such as Docker, effectively require all containers to run as root by way of the Docker daemon on the system. 

Podman is different in that regard.  Because it does not rely on a root-level service to be active to be able to run a container, containers can instead be run as normal users on the system.  How it does this is a bit beyond the scope of this workshop, but in short it does this through linux user namespace mapping.  

When running as a non-root user on the host system, any container that is setup to run as root (like our apache webserver container) will present instead as the user who started the container to the host system.  This can further limit exposure of the host system.  Let's try this out.

. First, before we do anything else, be sure to shutdown the currently running container

====

[NOTE]

You will notice that the container needs to be downloaded again.  Didn't we do this already?  We did, but as `root`.  Each user keeps their own local container storage separate from all other users.

+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

ls -l /var/log/www/hello_from_rootless_podman.txt
----
+
. It should appear that the files are created by root
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
-rw-r--r--. 1 #root# #root# 0 Jun 14 13:25 /var/log/www/hello_from_rootless_podman.txt
----
+
. This makes sense as you are still running in the container as root.  Prove this by running:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
whoami
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
root
----
--
====

The noteworthy part is what we see on the *host* filesystem.  From the main shell (which is running directly on the host and not in a container), let's take a look at the file we created (that recently appeared in the explorer)

[tabs]
====
Terminal 1::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ls -l {container-workshop-exercise-path}/hello_from_rootless_podman.txt
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
-rw-r--r--. 1 #student1# #student1# 0 Jun 14 13:25 /home/student1/container-workshop/hello_from_rootless_podman.txt
----
--
====

The key here is that unlike before, the files on the host were created as `{USER}`, that is, the user that ran the `podman` command and not `root` as it appeared from inside the container

Podman is able to accomplish this through "namespacing" and mapping container UIDs to different UIDs on the host.  Any container running as `root` when running as rootless podman will always present to the host (such as via volume mounts) as the user that ran the rootless podman command in the first place.

This affords an additional layer of (preventative) security as even containers that think they are running as root are not actually running with such privileges on the host

Finally, remember how we ran this container with the `--privileged` flag even though we know that it confers extra powers to the container?  Let's try our `fdisk` trick again

[tabs]
====
{metasploit-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
fdisk -l
----

But this time it will appear as if we had not run with the `--privileged` flag at all:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

----
--
====

This is again due to the fact that the container is not actually running as root on the host system, it is running as `{USER}` and `{USER}` does not have permissions to run `fdisk` normally.  Hence rootless containers afford additional layers of security on top of the ones we indicated already

[#scanning_containers]
== Scanning Containers for Security Issues

So far we've seen some techniques podman (and Red Hat Enterprise Linux) give us to limit the impact of any *unknown* security vulnerabilities, but is there a way we can actively look for vulnerabilities and ensure they are not part of our containers in the first place?

In this section we'll look at one form of container security scanning based on OSCAP.  We'll use our container (which clearly has security vulnerabilities) as a target of our OSCAP scan and let's see what turns up

[TIP]
====
Container and security scanning has come a very long way.  We're about to show a very fundamental approach to container scanning, but it is by no means the latest and greatest approach.  However, running through the section below will give you the idea of what many of the tools in market are based on
====

=== Vulnerability Scanning with `oscap-podman`

The link:https://static.open-scap.org/openscap-1.2/oscap_user_manual.html[Open Security Content Automation Protocol^] (or OSCAP) refers to an open standard for quantifying vulnerabilities (or security policy infringements) that may be present in an operating system.  The aggregated wisdom of all the Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVEs) are codified in publicly available xml documents in the link:https://oval.mitre.org/[OVAL^] (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) xml format which oscap tooling can consumefootnote:[For policy checking, there is a separate type of format that OSCAP tooling can consume called EXensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (or XCCDF) files.  XCCDF files are used to can images/operating systems for compliance with a number of prescritive standards such as CIS and PCI-DSS]

One of podman tools is an oscap compatible scanner, called `oscap-podman` which adapts oscap for use with containers instead of just operating systems.

. To save time, we have provided you with a suitable oval document already.  Let's take a quick look at it by using kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on MacOS) to quickly open `rhel-7-oval.xml` (which can be found in the `container-workshop\oval` directory on your instance)
+

<.> This indicates that we are wanting to evaluate the document using the `oval` format (as opposed to XCCDF)
<.> This is the location of the oval document we just viewed in VS Code
<.> Indicates that we want the output as an (HTML) report in the specified directory

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order for `oscap-podman` to be able to scan an image, it must already be present locally on the machine (for the `root` account) or you will get errors like

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Target of the scan not found: '{apache-server-image-insecure}'.
----

If you get this error, first run this command before running the `oscap-podman` command above

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sudo podman pull {apache-server-image-insecure}
----

+
. The command might appear to do nothing for 30 seconds or so, but then you should see a flood of output somthing like this (showing only the last few lines):

[.console-output]

+
. On the right side of the screen, you should now see the generated report (as also seen in the image below).  Feel free to scroll around to get familiar with the output.  This report shows how our container fared against the different vulnerability checks and in our case indicates one big security issue.

. Your `Browser Preview` should navigate to Red Hat's CVE information on the exploit which, in this case, is the famous Shellshock vulnerability that we have been expoiting on our container for most of this lab.

[TIP]
====
When clicking on the link, a new Browser Preview will open in a new tab.  This may clutter up your workspace.  To make things more readable you can: 

* Close the Browser Preview with the vulnerability report and double-click on the Browser Preview tab with the Red Hat CVE info
* Copy the URL of the Red Hat CVE info and paste in a separate tab of your own browser (this an the following URLs are not local to your code-server instance)

. Feel free to read through the advisory.  To determine how to fix the issue we're going to follow the "Vulnerability Response" link highlighted below
+
.Red Hat advisory on Shellshock CVE

+
. Once on the security bulletin, select the "Resolve" tab as shown below.  From this we can see that the recommended remediation is to update the version of bash that is running in our container to `bash-4.2.45-.el7_0.4`

Now that we know what we need to do to our container, we're left with the question of HOW we're meant to update the container given that containers are supposed to be immutable.  When dealing with containers, we don't need to change the running container, but rather the _image_ that the container runs as.  In our case we're going to want to update our `{apache-server-image-insecure}` image.

This is where `buildah` comes in, which we'll explore next.
