[TIP]
====
If you have accidentally closed your metasploit terminal, you can recreate/reopen it by following xref:metasploit_setup_standalone.adoc[these instructions,window=_blank] fully in the other tab and then returning to this point in the lab.

If you've left your terminal open, you may need to first press kbd:[RETURN] to get back to the metasploit command line.  When you do so you may be greeted with the following prompt:
