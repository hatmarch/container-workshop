We are going to run metasploit as a non-root user in another terminal which we'll refer to as *Terminal 2* in the tabs below.  If you haven't already, you can split your terminal to open a new, non-root, shell

Then run the following commands in the newly created terminal:

<.> The `-x` option allows us to pass commands directly into metasploit (see following explanations of each).  We use this to save setup time
<.> This is a metasploit module that plugs into the console.  There is a whole library of modules that are used with metasploit.  This one specifically targets the shellshock vulnerability via Apache's cgi-bin support
<.> This is the address of the server (which we're running locally in a container)
<.> The port the container is listening on (in our case the port that is forwarded to the container via the `-p` option to `podman run`)
<.> The public ip address of the VM instance (as reported by `dig`).  This is necessary for how metasploit works
<.> The target URL of a cgi-bin script.  Those that are astute might recognize this as the cgi-bin endpoint of the guestbook page (`hello.html`)

If asked if you want to setup a new database, answer no
