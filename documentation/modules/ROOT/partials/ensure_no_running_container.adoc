Make sure there are no containers running with the `{stop-container-name}`

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rm -f {stop-container-name}
----

[TIP]
====
If there were a container running you would see something like: 

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
17af59003b1f956717b2a90919119b20bca1133e3677999f628f00e026a0079f
----

And if there weren't one running you would see something like: 

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Error: failed to evict container: "": failed to find container "my-web-server" in state: no container with name or ID my-web-server found: no such container
----

If the output you see is either of the above, it's okay to proceed.
