== Containerized Databases

[WARNING]

Given that containers have the ability to mount other (persistent) filesystems, database servers also become candidates for running in containers.  (Non ephemeral) containerized databases use volume mounts for their `data` directory where they write and persist the contents of the database to the filesystem.

. Start your database by running the following command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    --rm #<.>
    --name mysql_database #<.>
    -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db <.>
    -p 3306:3306
    quay.io/mhildenb/mysql-80
----
<.> This means the container should be removed once stopped
<.> Instead of referring to the container by its `Container ID` we can provide a name by which we'd like to address the container
<.> These are environment variables that we would like to be made available within the container.  In this instance, these are all environment variables that MySQL uses to set itself up
+
. The terminal should be taken over with log output from the container.  This is because we did not run the container in "daemon mode" and instead it is running in the foreground of our terminal.
. Open a second terminal to the side by hitting the terminal split button
+

. Observe the running container image by running the `podman ps` command

:navtitle: Container Concepts and Security

We'll go deeper into some container concepts in this exercise using a MySQL database running in a container 

== Containers and Persistence

Containers are meant to be run as "immutable" instances meaning that they are not mean to persist changes in state.  So if that's true, why would anyone attempt to run a database in a container.  Through out this section we will aim to answer this whilst demonstrating some additional container concepts.

=== Start Database Container

. Start your database by running the following command:
+
[.console-input]

    --rm #<.>
    --name mysql_database #<.>
    -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db <.>
    -p 3306:3306
